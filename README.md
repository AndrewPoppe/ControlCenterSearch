# Control Center Search

## About

Control Center Search is a REDCap External Module that adds search functionality to the Control Center.

## Installation

Please install from the REDCap Repo

## Usage

Once enabled, it adds a search bar to the top of the left-side menu in the control center.

Type the phrase you'd like to search for, and the module filters the links in the left-side menu to include only the pages that contain that text.

When you hover over any of the control center links after searching, a preview of the matched text in context will appear.

Clicking on any of the matches will take you to that page and scroll you to the appropriate section of the page.

*Note: Any spaces in the search term are replaced with wildcards to make the search a little more flexible (E.g., "The greatest" will find "**The** cake is my **greatest** joy")*
